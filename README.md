# NG-Files
D2R NG+ Shared stash files

IMPORTANT - ALL STASHES ARE LEGIT FINALLY! PLEASE ENSURE YOU ARE USING THE ZIP FILE FROM 14/02/2024.

To use these simply unzip them and then copy your chosen NG+ setup into your D2R Save Directory (Default Pathway is "User/Saved Games/Diablo II Resurrected")

Please make sure that if you have any items in your shared stash you want to keep that you copy the Shared stash file out of the saved directory first.

Massive thanks to CMD, Kano, Jymnasium, Mekalb, Lucky and Bender for all the ideas, testing and support you guys have put in to make these stashes as good as they are.
