# NG-Files
D2R NG+ Shared stash files

To use these simply unzip them and then copy your chosen NG+ setup into your D2R Save Directory (Default Pathway is "User/Saved Games/Diablo II Resurrected")

Please make sure that if you have any items in your shared stash you want to keep that you copy the Shared stash file out of the saved directory first.
